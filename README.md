# Data-Scraping-Collection-Preparation-and-Time-Series-Analysis

# Introduction
The objective of this Project is to collect historical stock price data from HTML  pages, construct time series representations from the collected data, then analyze and compare the resulting series. 

# Tasks
### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- a) Select four stocks to analyse from the page below. Use Python to download 
the HTML pages for your chosen stocks:
http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/COMP30760/timeseries.html
- b) Use Python to parse and extract the relevant stock price data from each 
selected stockâ€™s HTML page.
- c) Replace any missing values in each dataset with appropriate values.
- d) Save the preprocessed versions of the four time series datasets in an 
appropriate format.


### 2. Time Series Analysis 
- a) Load the preprocessed time series datasets from Task 2 into an appropriate 
data structure.
- b) Characterise and visualise each time series individually at daily, monthly, 
and quarterly frequencies. 
- c) Quantify and discuss how each time series is changing over time. This 
should include identifying and highlighting any peaks and troughs which 
occur in each series.
- d) Compare and discuss the similarity of the trends appearing in the different 
series to one another.
- e) At the end of your notebook, summarise any insights which you gained from 
your analysis of the data and suggest ideas for further analysis which could 
be performed on the data
